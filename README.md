# Cricket-analytics-project
This project is a comprehensive cricket analytics tool that uses data-driven methods to help identify the best playing XI for a cricket team based on players' past performances.By scraping player statistics from ESPN, performing detailed data cleaning and analysis using Python's Pandas, and visualizing the results in an interactive Power BI dashboard, the project delivers actionable insights for team selection.
The key features of the project include:

Data Collection: Web scraping cricket statistics such as runs scored, wickets taken, strike rate, average, economy rate, and other performance metrics from ESPN.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and transforming it to make it ready for analysis using Pandas.
Interactive Dashboard: Power BI is used to build an interactive dashboard that provides a visual representation of key performance metrics. Users can filter and explore the data based on specific criteria (e.g., formats, match types).
Best Playing XI Selection: The dashboard enables users to identify the best possible playing XI based on performance data, helping coaches, analysts, and fans make informed decisions.
This project demonstrates the power of web scraping, data analysis, and visualization tools in deriving meaningful insights from raw sports data. It is particularly useful for cricket analysts, enthusiasts, and team selectors who want to make data-backed team selection decisions.
